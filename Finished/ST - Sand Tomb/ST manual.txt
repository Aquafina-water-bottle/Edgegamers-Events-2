[B][U][FONT="Century Gothic"]General Info[/FONT][/U] [/B]
This event is hosted similarly to Anvil drop, due to its similar nature. Thus, the system is pretty similar. The main difference is that the EC has to customly set the sand.

[B]Main lever:[/B] This adds the scoreboards, and essensially makes the game work. When the doors are open, it turns off the scoreboards so people can be added again.
[B]Countdown button:[/B] This displays a countdown, but nothing special happens at the end of the countdown. This is simply for EC usage, if they want a simple countdown before setting the sand.
[B]End game button:[/B] This removes all of the previously added scoreboards and removes the sand.
